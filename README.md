## Components

### Microcontroller
- Arduino Nano, Arduino Uno, ESP32, or any microcontroller supporting C++  
- (This project uses Arduino Uno for example)

### LEDs and Sound
- Buzzer (x1)  
- LEDs: Red, Yellow, Green, White (or Laser module instead of White LED)  

### Resistors
- 220 Ω resistors (x4/x3)  
- 10 KΩ resistor (x1)  

### Other Hardware
- Breadboard (very important for wiring)  
- Photoresistor (Light dependent resistor, x1)  
- Buttons (x2)  
- Jumper wires for connections

### Optional
- Laser module (if you want to replace the white LED with a laser)
